# Wukong for Linked Data

Wukong is a fast and distributed graph-structured store that leverages efficient graph exploration to proivde highly concurrent and low-latency query processing over big linked data.


## Feature Highlights

* High-performance and scalable in-memory graph store
* Fast and concurrent SPARQL query processing by graph exloration
* Fast communication by leveraging RDMA feature of InfiniBand network
* A GPU extension of query engine for heterogenous (CPU/GPU) cluster
* A type-centric SPARQL query plan optimizer

For more details see [Wukong Project](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/projects/wukong), including new features, roadmap, instructions, etc.
